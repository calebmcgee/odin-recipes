            <li>16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at a cool room temperature, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons granulated garlic (garlic powder)</li>

    <div class="steps">
        <h2 >Steps</h2>
        <ol  class="steps-list">
            <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Use cooking oil spray to grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and the non-shiny side of a large piece of aluminum foil, then place the dish on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the brown sugar, seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and nutmeg in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Place the butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer or handheld mixer (or use a firm spoon); beat on medium speed until well incorporated. Stop to scrape down the bowl. Add the whole milk, evaporated milk and eggs, beating on low speed to incorporate, until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine the cooked macaroni, the shredded sharp cheddar cheese and the Velveeta cubes in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter mixture and spice mixture, stirring gently to distribute and coat evenly. Transfer to the baking dish on the baking sheet. Cover tightly with the foil (sprayed side down). Bake for 30 minutes, uncover and stir the mixture, then recover and bake for an additional 15 to 30 minutes or until just set.</li>
            <li>Uncover; scatter the mild cheddar evenly over the top, then sprinkle lightly with the paprika. Return to the oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until a crust forms on top. Serve warm.</li>
